Making ClanLib even better

We are grateful for all the help we can get, and if you wish to contribute with
anything, don't hesitate to contact us.

If you have fixed something in ClanLib, you can send us a patch. Please have a
look at the PATCHES file for more detailed information.

A developer's reference is available. This contains all the internal classes

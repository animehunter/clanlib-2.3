      Summary: Using spotlights

This program demonstrates how to create an opengl spotlight in a shader

This engine uses the left hand winding rule. OpenGL uses the right hand winding rule.
Collada uses the right hand winding rule.

So the model importer inverts the winding rule. 
(The object coordinates are based on Newtek's Lightwave 3D modeller that uses the left hand winding rule)

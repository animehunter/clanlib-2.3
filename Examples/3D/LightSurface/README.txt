      Summary: Using distant light in a surface

This program demonstrates how lighting can enhance a surface

This engine uses the left hand winding rule. OpenGL uses the right hand winding rule.
Collada uses the right hand winding rule.

So the model importer inverts the winding rule. 
(The object coordinates are based on Newtek's Lightwave 3D modeller that uses the left hand winding rule)
